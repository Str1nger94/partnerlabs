Open Forum for F5 Lab Environments and Lab Guides
=================================================

Welcome to the F5 Lab Environments and Lab Guides *last updated on 1 NOV 2021*.  This it an **unofficial** site that covers how to access access F5's *invitation only* **Unified Demo Framework** environment or build a **Do-It-Yourself (DYI) F5-AWS Lab** environment using an pre-built AWS Cloudformation template (CFT)

These labs are designed to be used by our customer and partner community to familiarize engineers with F5 solutions and/or help prepare for certification.  Lab guides should generally work with both lab environments there will be some limitations depending on the environment used and these differences are noted in the lab guides.

.. important::
   All material in this Github repo supporting certification is created and maintained by exam candidates, some of whom happen to work for F5 Networks, and **are not officially supported or sanctioned by the F5 Certification Program**.  *In fact, nothing on this site is officially supported by F5 and done on a best effort basis*

.. Note:: 
   **It is not my official roll to create this material.  I add to this content as my personal time permits with the hope that it will aid you in learning F5 solutions and help you achieve your certifications.**  I also hope as things progress I will get help and suggestions from the F5 community at large.
