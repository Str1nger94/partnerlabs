Unofficial - F5 Partner Labs
============================

Welcome to the Partner Labs Guides last updated on 16 JUL 21

These labs are designed to familiarize engineers with F5 solutions and in some cases help prepare for certification.

.. warning::
   All material in this repo supporting certification is created and maintained by exam canidates, which happen to work for F5 Networks, and **are not officially supported by the F5 Certification Program**.  In fact, nothing on this site is officially supported and is best effort.

.. important:: 
   **It is not our official roll to create this material so we add to this content as our personal time permits with the hope that it will aid you in learning F5 solutions and help you achieve your certifications.**
