WAF - Identifying the level of protection required for applications 
===================================================================
This class, run by Optiv Security, looks at how to strategically build policies around which applications require AWAF protection, what level of protection and how to deploy AWAF policies consistently using best practices and easing maintenance.  

This lab is based on a prior Agility lab created by F5. This lab does not require deep knowledge of the BIG-IP WAF soltuion.  The intent of the lab is demonstrate how you can balanced security, administration, and resources by using parent and child polices security policies and get an understanding of how child policies can inherit changes from the parent policy and limit the types of customizations that can be made to a child policy.
