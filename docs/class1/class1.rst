Guides to the Lab Environments
==============================
Currently there are instructions on the use of one of three environments where you can run the partner labs.  

These are:

* The **Unified Demo Framework (UDF)** F5's official lab and demo environment
   * This environment requires you work with you F5 field or channel engineer to obtain access.
* The **World-Wide Field Readiness (WWFR)** vLab found on https://downloads.f5.com 
   * This lab can run in your own environment, but requires VMWare ESX or Workstation.
* The AWS F5 Lab CFT (Cloud Formation Template) an **unofficial** pay-as-you-go environment.
   * This lab runs in AWS at a very nominal cost and can be easy set up and torn down as desired.

All labs use the same backend servers and IP addressing scheme.  Any exceptions will be noted in the environment set up guide or the various lab guides.
